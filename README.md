# AWS CDK Sketchnotes

After battling through the depths of the documentation, I finally managed to make a pull request to my laptop with these steps!

## Prerequisites

### GitHub

* Update the fork with the current main branch from aws-cdk.
* Pull the current state to local notebook in VS Code.

### Local Environment Setup

Required tools and dependencies (I need to update this ...):

- **Node.js** (LTS version)
- **yarn** (package manager)
- **AWS CLI** (for account access)
- **GitHub CLI** (version control)
- ...


#### Development + System Requirements
- I've added 16 GB as SWAP-file on my local notebook ...
- I'm running all steps in a local Shell - Hence, I've closed closed VS Code, browsers, and other memory-intensive applications during builds to prevent out-of-memory errors.


#### Shell Environment Variables

Set Node.js memory limits:

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"
```

#### AWS Account Setup

"Create" (or use) an AWS account and configure credentials:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=G..
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=..AY
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

Verify AWS connection:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

#### CDK Bootstrap

For new or temporary accounts, bootstrap CDK (replace with the account ID):

```bash
cdk bootstrap 1234567890/us-west-2 --no-use-default-kms --no-execution-role
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Check and/or Change your local git branch

Directory: `~/git/github/aws-cdk/` (root)
```bash
git branch --show current
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Directory: `~/git/github/aws-cdk/` (root)
```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Build Integration Test Framework

Directory: `~/git/github/aws-cdk/` (root)
```bash
npx lerna run build --scope=@aws-cdk-testing/framework-integ
```
Note: The parameter `--skip-nx-cache` could help as well.

**Important**: The integ-runner works with compiled JavaScript files (.js), not TypeScript files (.ts)!

### 4. Code Changes

Make changes in the appropriate package path: `packages/aws-cdk-lib/<aws-component>`

Examples:
* `packages/aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs/lib/data-protection-policy.ts`
* `packages/aws-cdk-lib/aws-elasticloadbalancingv2/lib/alb/application-load-balancer.ts`

### 5. Unit Tests

Unit tests are located in corresponding test directories:

* TypeScript file directly under `lib/` → `test/`
* TypeScript file in subfolder, e.g., `lib/alb/` → `test/alb/`

#### Running Unit Tests

Directory: `~/git/github/aws-cdk/packages/aws-cdk-lib/`

Command:
(!) Here .ts file is used.

```bash
# ensure that you are on the correct git branch - could be checked via: git branch --show current
npx jest aws-logs/test/loggroup.test.ts --testNamePattern="DateOfBirth"
```

### 5. Rebuild After Changes

After making changes, rebuild the integration test framework:

```bash
npx lerna run build --scope=@aws-cdk-testing/framework-integ
```
You can also try (not tested here):
```bash
npx lerna run build --scope=@aws-cdk
```



### 6. Commit Your Changes

Now you can commit your code changes, unit tests, and integration tests:

Example PR: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/36558
* Code changes in `data-protection-policy.ts`
* Unit test in `loggroup.test.ts`
* Integration test in `integ.log-group.ts`

### 7. Integration Tests

Now the AWS account comes into play. Integration tests need updates, and the integ-runner handles this.

#### Running Integration Test and Update Snapshots

Directory: `~/git/github/aws-cdk/packages/@aws-cdk-testing/framework-integ/`

Command to update snapshots and CloudFormation templates:
(!) Here .js file is used!

```bash
npx integ-runner --parallel-regions us-west-2 --update-on-failed test/aws-logs/test/integ.log-group.js
```
